# Process Writeup

## Name: Hanaa Hassan
## Course: Data Structures (JS Basics)
## Period: 2
## Concept: Varibles and Strings


### Context

In our data structure course we are learning Javascript Basics to be able to make wbesites interactive. This also works with the use of html and css elements.
In the first few lessons in fcc data structures in JS Basics we learn about Variables and Strings. With variables it allows computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. This works through using a label to points to the data instead of using the data itself. You can also think of variables like the x and y variables in math in which they are a simple name that represents the data we want to refer to.
An example of how we would eclare a variable in Javascript is by using the keyword "var" infront of it. It would look like "var myName";
Strings also store and manpulate data and it is a collection of characters enclosed in single or double quotes like "123 cats"



Tasks

* Our task was to do the first 14 lessons FCC to learn and see how and what JS Basics look like and as we do that take notes on important stuff we need for our writeup.
### Process
  I first started off by going through the first few code camp lessons and taking some notes on things epecially  when i struggled on a specifc code a lot. 
  When i took the first JS Basics quiz i qucikly took notes after to review what i got wrong so that i can be more aware of what to do next time. Here is how some of the notes i took looked like.
  * Comments:
Comments in Javascript are lines of code that it will intentionally ignore. It is also a good way to leave notes to yourself and for other people who will need to figure out what the code does.
// tells Javascript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line.
To make a multiple line commenting being with */ and end with /*
String: Are a collection of characters in which computers can perform mathematical operations on a number but not on a string.
Assigning the value of one variable to another:After a value is assigned to a variable, you are able to assign the value of that variable to another variable and doing so using the assignment operator 
whatIsItCalledWhenVariablesAreNamedLikeThis?- Camel Case
As i was doing the first few i struggled the most with assigning the value of one variable to another. For this we were suppose to assign the contents of a to b so the contents of a and b was 7 and what i did was forget to assign the a to be with the =
All i really needed to do what read this over a couple of times because sometimes i like to just get things over with and fast but that little error had to make me pay for not getting it right.
